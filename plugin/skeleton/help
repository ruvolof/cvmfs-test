# Every plugin must have an help file. The line beginning with "Short:"
# will be dispalyed when the help command is invoked without any option.
# It's a good idea do not have more than one line for short description.
#
# Lines that start with "Long:" will be displayed if the command "help command"
# is invoked. Try to format your help and remember that usual terminal window
# consists of 80 character.

Long:	(in which these lines can be found) and main.pl, that is
